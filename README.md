## The development on Keith's Website Portfolio

This repo is used to create Keith's Web Portfolio. I plan to brand myself as a Creative Problem Solver / Designer, specializing in Product Design (UX/UI, Website, Mobile, etc.) yet still showcases my Graphic/Motion Design skills within the portfolio.

## My main pages will include:
[Home](#home)<br/>
[Works](#works)<br/>
[About](#about)<br/>
[Playground](#playground)<br/>

## Home 🏠 <a id="home"></a>
The homepage will showcase my demo reel motion video that I made with love! Also 3 of my featured works that I think the best I've done so far. More to come!

## Works 💻 <a id="works"></a>
Now this page will contain all of my works. All of it going to be a high-quality case studies that will interest you personally! Try having a look at some of it and I guarantee you that you guys will like them.

## About 😁 <a id="about"></a>
Now this page is all about me. Inside there will be a resume-like page that summarize my experiences, skills, and hobbies. Get to know me more as a person on my page! Also as a professional creative problem solver.
